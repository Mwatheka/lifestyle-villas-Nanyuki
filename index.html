Nanyuki is a town in Laikipia County, Kenya. <b>Nanyuki</b> is located along the Great North leading to Moyale, Addis Ababa, and beyond. Besides being a popular Kenya safari destination in Kenya, <b>Nanyuki town</b> is synonymous with Kenya Road trips. Founded in 1907 by British settlers as a small market town, Nanyuki soon grew commercially and economically. By 1930, Nanyuki’s potential justified the construction of a railway line linking the town to Nairobi. Presently a base for the Kenya Air Force and a training area for the British Army, Nanyuki continues to be an administrative and supply centre for farms, ranches, game parks and conservancies in the region. Nanyuki lies along the Equator, in the centre of the nation, and at an elevation of 1,947m above sea-level, is the 14th highest town in Africa. <b>Nanyuki town</b> is a jewel in Kenya’s crown.

          <h2><h2>How to Get to Nanyuki</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
Nanyuki is a wonderful town that lies on the equator. It’s located on the edge of central highlands and opens to the Laikipia Plateau and the wonders of northern Kenya. Nanyuki town is inhabited by people from different cultures, including local communities, ex-pats, descendants of early British settlers, and military personnel. Walking along the streets of this small town offers you an opportunity to experience this diverse characteristic and learn about its history. There are three main modes of transport from Nairobi to Nanyuki – Road, Railway, and Air. Nanyuki distance from Nairobi is about 147 km. Travelers can get there using private means, public Matatu’s, or in an overland truck. There is a passenger train from Nairobi to Nanyuki every Friday. And for faster travel, use local flights to Nanyuki airstrip. Nanyuki is approximately 3 – 4 hours north of Nairobi, depending on traffic. The drive, once you get past the congested roads around Thika are smooth going. Driving through banana and pineapple plantations, and if the day is clear heading for the snowy peaks of Mount Kenya. Several flights a day operate to the teeny Nanyuki airport, from Wilson airport in Nairobi. <b>Nanyuki airport</b> is located on the western foot hills of <b>Mount Kenya, </b> it lies only 8 kilometers, south of the Equator. <b>Nanyuki</b> is approximately 140 kilometers (87 mi), by air, north of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, the country's largest civilian airport. The <b>Nanyuki airport</b> has a single asphalt runway which measures 1,200 meters (3,900 ft) in length In the 1960s the <b>Nanyuki Airfield</b> was situated along the Nanyuki - Rumuruti Road. It was a grassy runway used by single engine, privately owned aircraft. During the 70s the site was purchased by the Kenya government for the air force, and named Laikipia Air Base. The new civil airfield for Nanyuki was moved to its current location between the towns of Naro Moru and Nanyuki. In the 70s Nanyuki Civil Airfield came into its own when the <b>Mount Kenya Safari Club</b> was attracting the wealthy and famous – and the first <b>Nanyuki charter flights</b> started venturing in. When Tropic Air set up its base here in 1983, there was only a patchy and overgrown tarmac runway and a single caretaker’s hut. Over the years, through investment and development, we have been instrumental in putting Nanyuki Airfield on the map as a major and vital air hub serving Northern Kenya, and linking the north with the rest of Kenya. Today <b>Nanyuki Airport</b> has an excellent reputation for its broad aviation services, along with its charming atmosphere, unique location and Barney’s restaurant! <b>Safarilink</b> operates two daily <b>scheduled flights to Nanyuki</b>‚ Lewa and Samburu.  These <b>Nanyuki flights</b> allow passengers access to all the conservancies in the Laikipia region‚ and to the trio of northern reserves: Samburu‚ Shaba and Buffalo Springs. Tropic Air is a privately owned air charter company, incorporated in the early 1990s at the time that northern Kenya’s low-impact and high value tourism lodges and camps were emerging. Nanyuki is a great town and is one of the best places to visit in Kenya. It’s the gateway to unexplored northern Kenya, Mount Kenya National Park, and wildlife conservancies in the Laikipia Plateau. Although there are many things to do in Nanyuki, a myth surrounding a lost railway route map has made the town more popular as an entertainment hotspot. The tale tells of how railway engineers got carried away by the fun and merry in Nanyuki. They lost the route map which marked the end of the Nairobi-Nanyuki railway and was supposed to extend to northern Kenya. If you’re interested in a taste of Nanyuki’s nightlife, go to the Downtown Club or Moran Lounge. After all, no trip to this town is complete without partying.

<b>Ol Pejeta Conservancy</b> is a 364sq km wildlife conservancy situated between the foothills of <b>Mount Kenya</b> and the <b>Aberdares</b> and its game-to-area ratio tops the Kenyan park and reserve league. Nestled in the foothills of the snow-capped Mount Kenya within Laikipia County in central Kenya, <b>Ol Pejeta Conservancy</b> stands as a pioneering force in the realm of conservation. Renowned for its dedicated efforts, the Ol Pejeta Conservancy gained global recognition for safeguarding the planet’s sole remaining pair of northern white rhinos. In addition, this idyllic location, framed by the majestic presence of Mount Kenya, underscores Ol Pejeta’s commitment to preserving endangered species and fostering biodiversity. The sanctuary’s proactive role in wildlife protection and habitat conservation makes it a symbol of hope and a leading example in the ongoing global endeavor to safeguard endangered species. Ol Pejeta Conservancy is a renowned wildlife haven in Kenya that promises a plethora of attractions. Nestled against the backdrop of breathtaking landscapes, this conservation marvel boasts an impressive array of wildlife, including the iconic Big Five. Planning a <b>Safari to Ol Pejeta Conservancy</b> the home of the last two northern white rhinos on Earth, visitors can also witness the unique interplay of nature and community initiatives, making it a holistic experience. Whether you seek thrilling safaris, conservation insights, or a connection with nature’s wonders, Ol Pejeta Conservancy awaits, offering diverse and enriching attractions. The Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya has over 10000 large mammals and it is the only park where the big 5 and chimpanzees can be seen. It is also where the fastest growing population of rhino in Africa can be found. There are southern white rhinos, about 80 endangered <b>black rhino</b> and in a special sanctuary there are two of the world’s last remaining northern white rhino. Safari by vehicle is not the only option at Ol Pejeta, safari game walks, horse rides and even camel rides are available, as are <b>safari night drives</b>. Since being established in 1988 Ol Pejeta has had a colorful list of previous owners including Lord Delamere, an early and influential settler from Britain, shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis’ father Roussel and the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. It was set up originally as a cattle ranch but herds of migrating elephant regularly destroyed the fenced enclosures making intensive cattle farming impracticable. Cattle still plays a role in Ol Pejeta today but as a managed livestock within the conservancy and is used to maximize the bio-diversity of the land making Ol Pejeta an integrated wildlife and livestock area. The conservancy is keen to educate as well and has an Environmental and Conservation Centre that welcomes around 100 Kenyan schools through its doors annually. The Centre focusses on teaching ecology, culture and the importance of sustainable wildlife management to safeguard the future of the conservancy. Visitors can also learn about local culture and traditions by meeting the peoples of the Samburu, Turkana, Pokot and Maasai.
